             Brett developed a passion for progressive advocacy early in his burgeoning
              political career, externing udner the Honorable Judge Jerry Esrig in the

            Brett has demonstrated an early interest in the field of data privacy 
            law. With the advent of the GDPR and the impending impact of massive data 
            breaches in the United States and abroad, Brett believes 
            that more attorneys and developers alike will be required to
            serve the interests of data subjects and protect the rights 
            of consumers.
